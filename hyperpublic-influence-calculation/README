Hyperpublic users can add their friends by emailing a photo of them to
add@hyperpublic.com. We want to determine a user’s influence on the system by
determining how many users he is responsible for. A user’s influence is calculated
by giving him 1 point for every user he’s added in addition to the sum of the
influence scores of each user that he’s added.

Example: User 0 adds User 1 and User 2. User 1 adds User 3.

User 0’s influence score is 3. (He added two users and one of them added added a
third user.)
User 1's is 1. 
User 2's is 0. 
User 3's is 0.

The above scenario is represented by the following input file. Line i is user ID
i and position j within the line is marked with an X if user ID i added user ID
j. Both row and column indicies are 0-based:

  OXXO
  OOOX
  OOOO
  OOOO
            
Problem: Given input file "challenge2input.txt", determine the highest influence
score from those 100 random Hyperpublic users. Actually determine the top three,
and list them in order e.g. 17, 5, 3 would be reported as "1753"
