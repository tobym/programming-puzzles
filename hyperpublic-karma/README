Hyperpublic has an internal karma system to determine which users are the most
involved in the ecosystem. Users earn points for the following tasks.

2 Points – Add Place
3 Points – Add Thing
17 Points – Tag Object
23 Points – Upload Photo
42 Points – Twitter Share
98 Points – Facebook Share

Being addicted to their own product, the Hyperpublic staff has racked up some big
karma. The members of the team have the following karma totals:

Doug – 2349 points
Jordan – 2102 points
Eric – 2001 points
Jonathan – 1747 points

Amazingly, they've all accomplished these totals in the minimum number of tasks
possible in order to reach each amount. For example, if their total was 6 points
they would have accomplished this in just 2 tasks (2 "Add Thing" tasks), as opposed
to accomplishing it by 3 "Add Place" tasks. Your job is to compute how many total
tasks each user has completed. After you've done so, find the answer to Problem 2
using the following formula:

Problem 2 Answer = Doug's total tasks * Jordan's total tasks * Eric's total tasks
* Jonathan's total tasks
